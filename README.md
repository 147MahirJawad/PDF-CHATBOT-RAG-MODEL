Ask Your PDF with Chunk Visualization

"Ask Your PDF" is a Streamlit application that allows you to upload a PDF document, process its content, and then ask questions about it. The application utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining a vector store (Qdrant) for efficient document retrieval and Google's Gemini-1.5 Flash model for generating answers.

## Features

  * **PDF Upload**: Easily upload your PDF documents.
  * **Intelligent Q\&A**: Ask questions about the content of your uploaded PDF and get accurate answers.
  * **Contextual Answers**: The RAG chain ensures answers are based solely on the provided document context, preventing hallucinations.
  * **Caching for Performance**: The vector store is cached to provide a smoother experience for subsequent interactions with the same document.

## How it Works

1.  **PDF Upload & Processing**: When you upload a PDF, the application first saves it temporarily.
2.  **Document Chunking**: The PDF content is loaded and split into smaller, manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3.  **Embeddings Generation**: These chunks are then converted into numerical representations (embeddings) using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` (specifically, the `embedding-001` model).
4.  **Vector Store Creation**: The embeddings and their corresponding document chunks are stored in a Qdrant vector database. For this application, an in-memory/local Docker Qdrant instance is used.
5.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
      * When you ask a question, the application retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the Qdrant vector store.
      * These retrieved chunks, along with your question, are then sent to the `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model.
      * The model generates an answer based on the provided context, ensuring that the response is directly relevant to your document.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * `pip` (Python package installer)
  * Docker (for running Qdrant locally)

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/147MahirJawad/PDF-CHATBOT-RAG-MODEL.git
cd PDF-CHATBOT-RAG-MODEL
```

### 2\. Set Up Your Google API Key

You'll need a Google API Key to use the Gemini models.

1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and create an API key.

2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
    ```

    Replace `"your_google_api_key_here"` with the API key you obtained.


### 3\. Run Qdrant with Docker

The application uses a local Qdrant instance. Make sure Docker is running on your system.

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```

This command pulls the Qdrant Docker image and runs it, mapping the necessary ports.

### 4\. Run the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This command will open the Streamlit application in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  **Upload PDF**: Click on the "Upload your PDF file" button and select your PDF document.
2.  **Processing**: The application will process your PDF, which may take a moment depending on the file size. A success message will appear once processing is complete.
3.  **Ask Questions**: Enter your question related to the PDF content in the "Ask a question about the document:" text box and press Enter.
4.  **View Answer**: The answer generated by the AI will be displayed under the "Answer" section.

## Troubleshooting

  * **`Google API Key not found`**: Ensure you have created a `.env` file in the correct directory and added your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to it.
  * **Qdrant Connection Issues**: Make sure your Docker daemon is running and the Qdrant container is successfully started on port `6333`. You can verify this by checking Docker Desktop or running `docker ps`.
  * **`An error occurred`**: Check the Streamlit console for more detailed error messages. This could be due to issues with PDF parsing, network connectivity, or API rate limits.
